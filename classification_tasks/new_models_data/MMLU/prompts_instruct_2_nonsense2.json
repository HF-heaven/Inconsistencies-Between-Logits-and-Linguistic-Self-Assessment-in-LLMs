He conducted a small farming operation on the property and grew corn, broccoli, and other vegetables, which he sold to local produce companies. One day, the county police received an anonymous tip that the defendant was growing marijuana on his farm. Acting on this information, in an unmarked vehicle, two undercover police officers then drove to the defendant's farm. They climbed over a chain-link fence and walked around the farm. While surveying the terrain, they came upon a small marijuana patch. The officers then noticed fresh footprints that led from the marijuana patch to a nearby cabin. Believing that marijuana was being stored in the cabin, the police officers decided to immediately secure a search warrant. After obtaining the warrant, they returned to the defendant's farm and entered the cabin. Inside the cabin, the police found a large amount of marijuana that had been recently harvested. The defendant was then arrested and charged with unlawful possession of marijuana. The defendant files a pretrial motion to suppress the marijuana as evidence on grounds of an illegal search and seizure. The motion should be\n(a): denied, because the officers secured a warrant before entering the cabin despite the fact that their earlier actions may have been unlawful. \n(b): denied, because the warrant was validly issued and based upon information lawfully obtained. \n(c): granted, because the marijuana was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure, since the police did not have probable cause to conduct their investigation. \n(d): granted, because the police were unlawfully on the defendant's property when the marijuana was initially discovered. \nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

The judge denied him bail pursuant to a state law which states that for the crimes of rape, sexual assault on a child, and sexual assault, no person who stands accused thereof shall be entitled to bail prior to a trial in the courts of this state. The defendant was brought to trial and found guilty. After being sentenced to five to ten years in prison, the defendant appealed his conviction to the highest court in the state. The ground for his appeal was an argument that he was denied his right to counsel at the time of his arrest. While his appeal was pending, the defendant filed a civil rights action in federal court against the judge. The defendant claimed that the judge violated his rights under the excessive bail clause of the Eighth Amendment. The federal court should refuse to hear the case, because\n(a): the federal court would violate the principle of the separation of powers.\n(b): the issues are not ripe.\n(c): the case is moot.\n(d): the issue of bail is capable of repetition, yet evading review. \nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

The spa also provided health club facilities, such as saunas, steam rooms, and whirlpool baths. A 75-year-old spinster resided across the street from the spa. The spinster opposed the opening of the spa because she believed that it was a \"cover\" for an illegal operation. During the day, the spinster sat in her rocking chair on her front porch and observed a constant stream of businessmen entering the spa. On the evening of June 29, the spinster, disguising her voice, called the spa and told the businessman, \"You pimp, why don't you take your dirty trade elsewhere?\" Without paying any attention to the call, the businessman hung up. The spinster then began making repeated crank telephone calls to the businessman's establishment. Every hour on the hour for the next three weeks, the spinster made her crank calls, harassing the businessman and his employees. As a result of the hourly phone calls, spa business was constantly disrupted, causing the businessman to suffer a decline in the volume of customers. After contacting the police, the businessman discovered that the spinster was the person making the harassing calls. If the businessman asserts a claim against the spinster, the theory on which he will most likely prevail is\n(a): public nuisance.\n(b): private nuisance.\n(c): intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n(d): negligence.\nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

It is to be set by the hands, with ligatures, and even cords applied, the one above and the other below the fracture. When the fracture takes place at one end, if at the head of the thigh, the middle part of a thong wrapped round with wool, so that it may not cut the parts there, is to be applied to the perineum, and the ends of it brought up to the head and given to an assistant to hold, and applying a ligature below the fracture, we give the ends of it to another assistant to make extension. If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture.\"\nPaul of Aegina, Epitome: On the Fracture of the Thigh and Nose, late seventh century C.E.\nSource 2:\n\"Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health. The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.\"\nIbn Sina (Avicenna), On Medicine, ca. 1020 C.E.\nWhich of the following characterizes both of the passages?\n(a): A reliance upon supernatural understandings of physical phenomena\n(b): A reliance upon reason and rationalistic understandings of physical phenomena\n(c): A reliance upon abstract philosophical understandings of physical phenomena\n(d): A reliance upon astrological understandings of physical phenomena\nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

While the husband was passed out on the living room couch, the wife decided to fix herself a martini. After drinking two martinis, the wife became extremely inebriated.

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n—Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nWhich author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson?\n(a): Rachel Carson in Silent Spring.\n(b): Ralph Ellison in Invisible Man.\n(c): Helen Hunt Jackson in A Century of Dishonor.\n(d): William Lloyd Garrison in The Liberator.\nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

Much to Darlene's chagrin, officials at the plant had announced plans to reopen the plant. Darlene, who was a waitress at a local restaurant, devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate oysters at her restaurant with small amounts of a poisonous substance. Although she didn't want to seriously injure anyone, Darlene believed that if some people got sick from eating the oysters, they would attribute their illness to nuclear waste from the power plant. To facilitate her plan, she stole some poison from a local pharmacy. She sprinkled it on some oysters at the restaurant where she worked. Mistakenly, she put too much of the poison on some of the oysters. A few of the customers who ate the oysters became sick and nauseated. One person suffered convulsions and died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing, or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \"Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction. There are no separate felonies relating to adulterating food or poisoning. The most serious crime for which Darlene can properly be convicted is\n(a): first-degree murder, because her acts were intentional and premeditated. \n(b): first-degree murder, because the death occurred during the commission of a felony. \n(c): second-degree murder, because of the intent to cause physical harm. \n(d): manslaughter, because her conduct was reckless. \nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

The chair struck the pedestrian on the head, knocking her unconscious. When the pedestrian recovered consciousness, she found herself in a nearby hospital with a doctor in attendance. An examination revealed that the pedestrian had suffered a concussion and severe head lacerations. A subsequent investigation revealed that the chair had, in fact, been thrown from a window at the hotel. None of the hotel's employees or guests, however, admitted culpability for the incident. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the hotel for negligence, will the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur enable her to recover?\n(a): Yes, because the chair was within the control of the hotel. \n(b): Yes, because a chair is not usually thrown from a window in the absence of someone's negligence. \n(c): No, because the chair was not within the control of the hotel at the time the pedestrian was injured. \n(d): No, because the hotel is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its employees. \nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.… It is always the people who toil that pay.\n—Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nWhich of the following political ideas best reflects the perspective of Calvin Coolidge in the passage above?\n(a): Taxation is an effective means of redistributing wealth.\n(b): Government should be limited.\n(c): A bigger government can ensure social justice.\n(d): Government has the final say on what people do with their property.\nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n—John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following was NOT an abuse of the Catholic Church that Calvin and other religious leaders criticized?\n(a): Papal wealth\n(b): Pluralism\n(c): Nepotism\n(d): Indulgences\nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?

He further testified that the idea of robbing the bank had first been suggested by one of the defendants, and that afterward, the undercover officer stated that he thought it was a good idea. Thereafter, the defendants' counsel called a witness who testified that the undercover officer had a bad reputation for truthfulness.

The second witness's proposed testimony is\n(a): admissible, because the hoax resulted in a reprimand of the undercover officer. \n(b): admissible, because a hoax is probative of the undercover officer's untruthfulness. \n(c): inadmissible, because it is essentially cumulative impeachment. \n(d): inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a specific instance of misconduct. \nWhat's your answer and your confident score (0-10) of this answer?
